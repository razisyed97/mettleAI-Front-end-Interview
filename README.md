# mettleAI Front-End Developer Intern Interview

## Assumptions

- Build a one page web application where data can be inputed to a maximum of 5 forms.
- Create features only described in the design spec and readme

## Next Steps

- Use redux to keep track of user data if this project were to get extended into a full web app
- Create more intuitive behaviour for form expansion when deleting a MUI expansion form.
- Implement tighter form validation. Eg: date is properly formatted or validating a real email
- More specific error message alert regarding missing required fields
- Add button animations for adding, sending, and deleting a form. This includes disabled button states. 
- Create a more user friendly experience when using autocomplete to fill in address field (enter button must be pressed to hide the autocomplete forms)
- Hide my api key when deploying
- Loading icon while asynchronous request is being processed by server

## How to run

1. Make sure to have your node runtime environment configured properly with node package manager as this is needed to install dev dependencies.
Use this if not installed already: https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html

2. Clone repo to your computer.

3. Cd into the root folder where package.json is located through the terminal.

4. Run: npm install (this will likely take some time).

5. Run: npm start.
