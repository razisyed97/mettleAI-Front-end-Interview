## Assumptions 🤔

* Create a Patient Referral Form according to the specifications provided using Material UI and Use Places Autocomplete. 
* Add 'Save' button to the intake form. Save button allows user to save or update their form prior to final submission creating a more intiuitive UI experience. 

## If I had more time ⏰:

* Dynamically render success and error messages. 
* Use redux to manage state of data for application scalability. 
* Better form field validation (ex. email format, password, DOB format). 
* Enhance styling on form component (ex. add 'saving' spinner, form placement and icons).
